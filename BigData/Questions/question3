Question 35 pts
A string G is said to be a subset of a given string S if it can be formed by removing zero or more characters from the given string S.

You are given couple of strings S1 and S2 and you must find out if a string G can be formed which is a subset of both the strings S1 and S2 or not. Once found,
 you have to print the length of the common string G.

Input Format
 The first line contains the string S1.
 The second line contains the string S2.

Output Format
The output should contain an integer value denoting the length of the common string G.
If nothing matches, the output should be 0.

Constraints
Strings are case-sensitive. For example, string ’learner’ & ‘Learner’ are different.
0 < length(S1) < 100
0 < length(S2) < 100
Sample Test Cases

Input
RAMESH
RAJESH

Output
5

Explanation:
Because RAESH is the common subset of both the strings.

Input
RAMESH
ramesh
Output
0
Explanation: Because strings are case-sensitive.
